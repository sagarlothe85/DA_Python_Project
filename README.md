**Random Forest & XGBoost Model for Waze Dataset**

**Overview**

This project implements Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers to predict user retention based on various features from the Waze dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. Visualizations are provided to offer insights into feature importance and model performance.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature engineering, and summary statistics.

Modeling: Train and evaluate models using Random Forest and XGBoost.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance using GridSearchCV.

**Visualizations**:

Feature importance plots
Confusion matrices
